Data Analysis Script:
1. Reads the integrated dataset from the interim data folder
2. Preproccesses the data by: 
3. Dropping any row with NaN values
4. Encodes categorical variable start_station_id
5. Adjusts hour to datetime data type
6. Splits hour into 3 different numeric columns of hour_of_day, day_of_week, month
7. Drops the original hour and start_station_id variables for testing
8. Samples 50% of the original data since dataframe is too big for analysis
9. Splits the data further into 80% of the sample data as training data, and 20% as testing
10. Fit a RandomForestRegressor from scikit learns ensemble library
11. Used Root Mean Squared Error to see model performance

Data Visualization Script:
Created a Correlation Heatmap using the seaborn module. Checks which weather types are more correlated to the amount of trips taken during that hour. 
Created a Scatter Plot from the Matplotlib.pyplot module for actual trips vs predicted trips. Shows if the model is biased and the variance between actual and predicted trip values.
