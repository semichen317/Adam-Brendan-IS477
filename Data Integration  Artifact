Data Integration script:
1. Loads the cleaned NOAA and Divvy data
2. Merges the two datasets on the hour variable, using a left merge on the divvy dataframe
3. Created a CSV of the integrated dataset ready for analysis

Structure of the final merged dataset:
start_station_id, hour, trips, temp_c, wind_ms, precip_mm
